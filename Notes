2x Chokes ~33uH

40w output into 8ohm load @ Vdd = 25V
iout = ~2.23A
Choose 3A choke

XAL6060-333ME_ from coilcraft
---------------------------
2x L6060-333ME_	
L = 33uH
R = 95.68mohm
Isat = 3.7A
Irms = 2.7A (20C)
Irms = 3.6A (40C)

Dimensions
6.36mm x 6.56mm x 6.1mm

Cin (Bulk cap)
------------
~2x 200uF (35V)
P/N: EEE-1VA221UP
8mm Dia , 10.2mm height

Output Connector
----------------
-Just say 10mm x 10mm for now 
-(Have not decided on exact connector yet)
-These will probably determine the height
-1715721 <- This part did not work (collision)
	-13.8mm high

-OSTTC022162
	-10mm high, (same pitch) 
	-Double check to see if this will fix the collision issue

Audio Amp (tpa)
-----------
10mm x 10mm

Stack Headers
-------------
From - ELEC/Datasheets/0.1in ....
8.5 + (10.5 - 6.4) = 12.5mm = board to board space during stack, no parts on the bottom

Dimensions Breakdown
---------------------
