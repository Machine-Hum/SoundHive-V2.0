TODO (Gates):
	1. Power PCB 
		a) Component Selection
			-Single supply opamp (Low iq)
				-LMV358LIDT
			-5V Linear regulator (Low iq)
				-LM9036MX-5.0/NOPB
				-TI Part, be careful
			-Powerline FET (Enhansement N-Channel)
				-AO4576
			-Resistor selection

Output Connector
----------------
-OSTTC022162
	-10mm high, (same pitch) 
	-This fixes the collision issue

Header Pinout (Say 2x 1x8 for now)
----------------------
(J1)
H1.1 +24V
H1.2 +24V
H1.3 +24V
H1.4 +24V
H1.5 GND
H1.6 GND
H1.7 GND
H1.8 GND

(J2)
H2.1 I2C_SDA (Future)
H2.2 I2C_SCL (Future)
H2.3 5V (Future)
H2.4 12V (Future)
H2.5 AUX_L
H2.6 AUX_R
H2.7 AUX_GND - This just gets rolled into PGND
H2.8 SYNC

Roadmap (Future stuff)
---------------------
40W Switching amplifier
	-Rev 0.1 complete
		-Required new termial connector, collision issues
		-Probably needs a volume knob. How should I do this?
		-If integrating a volume knob, might as well put in some LEDs

AUX input jack (3.5mm)
	-Single connector
		-Possibly 2x multiplexed?

Powerboard 
	-Barrel Connector
		-Straight in
	-XT60 input
		-Cuttoff Circuitry using a powerpath FET
			-Program in different cutoff voltage for different cell sizes
				-4-6 cell design (16.8V - 25.2V)
			-Make sure the quicient current is low, don't drain flat

Bluetooth module
	-For streaming audio
