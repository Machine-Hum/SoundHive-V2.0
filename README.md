SoundHive - V2.0
=========

SoundHive is a low cost open source audio amplifier, designed to be stacked much like Arduino, the
aim is to reduce electronic waste by utilizing existing speakers without having to buy new amplifiers. 
It also increased modularity and customization. This allows the ultimate flexibility of complete system design.
