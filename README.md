SoundHive - V2.0
=========

SoundHive is a low cost open source audio amplifier, designed to be stacked much like Arduino, the
aim is to reduce electronic waste by utilizing existing speakers. It's too common for people to buy 
a new home theatre system and dispose of the old equiptment, which ends up directly in a landfill.

The reality is that most of the speakers made ~20 years ago are high quality wooden builds, 
that sound awesome and simply can't be replaced by their shiny new plastic childen.

Soundhive also increased modularity and customization. This allows the greater flexibility.

V2.0 is an evolution of the original project, which can be found here: https://github.com/Machine-Hum/SoundHive
